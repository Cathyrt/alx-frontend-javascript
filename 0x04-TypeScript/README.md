## 1. Basic types in Typescript

Typescript provides several basic types that can be used to annotate variables and function return types. These include:

- `number`: represents numeric values
- `string`: represents textual values
- `boolean`: represents boolean values (true/false)
- `null` and `undefined`: represent absence of value
- `object`: represents non-primitive types
- `array`: represents an array of values
- `tuple`: represents an array with fixed-length and specific types for each element

## 2. Interfaces, Classes, and Functions

Interfaces, classes, and functions are powerful constructs in Typescript for defining the shape of objects, implementing object-oriented patterns, and encapsulating reusable code.

- Interfaces allow you to define the structure of an object, specifying the required and optional properties and their types.
- Classes provide blueprints for creating objects, allowing you to define properties, methods, and constructors.
- Functions can be assigned types, including the types of their parameters and return values.

## 3. Working with the DOM and Typescript

Typescript enables seamless integration with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive web applications. By using DOM manipulation techniques, you can access and modify HTML elements, respond to user events, and update the UI dynamically.

## 4. Generic Types

Generic types provide a way to define functions and classes that can work with a variety of data types while maintaining type safety. They allow you to write reusable code that is flexible and adaptable.

## 5. Using Namespaces

Namespaces are a way to organize code into logical groups and prevent naming collisions. They provide a container to encapsulate related classes, interfaces, functions, and variables. Namespaces can be nested to create a hierarchical structure.

## 6. Merging Declarations

In Typescript, declaration merging allows you to combine multiple declarations for the same entity into a single definition. This feature is useful when working with libraries or extending existing types.

## 7. Importing an External Library using Ambient Namespace

An ambient namespace declaration is used to import an external library or module into a Typescript project. It allows you to reference types and functions from the external library without explicitly importing them.

## 8. Basic Nominal Typing with Typescript

Nominal typing refers to the ability to differentiate between types based on their names or labels rather than just their structure. Although Typescript primarily uses structural typing, you can achieve nominal typing by leveraging unique symbols or literal types.
