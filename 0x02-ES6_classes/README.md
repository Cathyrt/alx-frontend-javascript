# ES6 Classes Guide

This guide provides an overview of ES6 classes in JavaScript, including how to define classes, add methods, use static methods, extend classes, and an introduction to metaprogramming with symbols.

## Defining a Class

To define a class in JavaScript using ES6 syntax, use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Here's an example:

```
class MyClass {
  // Class body
}
```

## Adding Methods to a Class

Methods can be added to a class by defining them within the class body. Here's an example:

```
class MyClass {
  myMethod() {
    // Method implementation
  }

  anotherMethod() {
    // Method implementation
  }
}
```

## Static Methods

Static methods belong to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. They can be added using the `static` keyword. Static methods are useful for defining utility functions or operations that don't depend on the instance state. Here's an example:

```
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    // Static method implementation
  }
}
```

To call a static method, use the class name followed by the method name:

```
MyClass.myStaticMethod();
```

## Extending a Class

Inheritance in classes can be achieved using the \`extends\` keyword. This allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. Here's an example:

```

class ParentClass {
  // Parent class definition
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  // Child class definition
}
```

The `ChildClass` now has access to all the properties and methods of the `ParentClass`.

## Metaprogramming and Symbols

Metaprogramming refers to the ability to programmatically inspect, modify, or create code at runtime. Symbols, introduced in ES6, are often used in metaprogramming to add or retrieve metadata from objects. They can be used to create unique keys for object properties or define well-known symbols. Here's an example:

```

const mySymbol = Symbol('description');

const myObject = {
  [mySymbol]: 'Some value'
};

console.log(myObject[mySymbol]); // Output: Some value
```

Symbols allow you to create properties that are hidden from regular object property enumeration and reduce the chance of accidental property name clashes.
